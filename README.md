IT 2030 - ASP.NET projects

### NOTE: I am using a laptop handed down to me by my mother for many of my projects. This class required I use a local repository to push my projects to GitHub. Unfortunately, it always uploads the files under my mother's user account instead of my own. I assure you this is all completely MY OWN WORK.
